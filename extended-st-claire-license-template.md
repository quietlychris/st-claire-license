PREAMBLE

The Extended St. Claire License is a purpose-specific prohibition license for software and other kinds of work, aiming to prevent use of the software in specific instances considered to be unethical by those who have built or contributed to that software. It is a variation on the standard St. Claire License, which gives primary consideration to the machine learning domain. 

To aid in enforcement of the Ethical Clauses, any works directly including or offering interaction through a remote network interaction to work under the Extended St. Claire License are required to reproduce or retain this copyright notice of use (including the list of conditions) for works covered by the Extended St. Claire License. The modified source DOES NOT need to be made available to the public.

With the exception of the restrictions clearly enumerated by the Ethical Clauses, and a Notice of Use, works covered by this license may be used in an unrestricted manner similar to software licensed under the MIT, Apache 2.0, or BSD licenses.
